Nicholas Crombie-<br> initiated express/node/mongoose packets, models built. I started building the controllers and will presume they will use basic CRUD functions in all models. need to check with Kyler/Tom about whether controllers will be necessary for all models/relations. need to check with kyler/tom or troy about primarykey's and dependant keys in the models.<br><br>

Matthew Denholm-<br> Session controller should have basic CRUD functionality. Views need to be hooked up still to confirm this.
